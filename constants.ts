- Wounds/statuses: +1-3 to difficulty.

## üé≤ CHECK SYSTEM
Formula: 1d20 + trait bonus
Bonus Calculation: The bonus is calculated from the attribute value. A baseline of 10 gives a +0 bonus. Every 2 points above 10 add +1 to the bonus, and every 2 points below 10 give a -1 penalty. The formula is: (Attribute Value - 10) √∑ 2, rounded down.

Critical Results:
- 20 on the die: critical success (effect √ó2).
- 1 on the die: critical failure (consequences √ó2).

Display: "Dexterity Check: 1d20+3=16 vs 15 ‚Üí Success!"
